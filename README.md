# CineViewHub Landing Page

This project is a modern, responsive landing page designed for an IPTV service provider ("CineViewHub"). It features a dark-themed UI with glassmorphism effects, interactive pricing cards, and dynamic content sections. The design focuses on converting visitors with clear calls to action, feature highlights, and customer testimonials.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptable layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Modern UI:** Utilizes a dark color palette, gradients, and `backdrop-filter` (glassmorphism) for a premium look.
-   **Dynamic Content:** Channel categories are populated dynamically using JavaScript.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Smooth scrolling navigation, hover effects on cards/buttons, and animated transitions.
-   **Comprehensive Sections:** Includes Hero, Features, Live Demo, Pricing, Activation Process, Premium Features, Channel Categories, Supported Devices, Testimonials, and Contact sections.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the page.
-   **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and responsiveness (Media Queries).
-   **JavaScript:** For DOM manipulation (dynamically creating channel cards) and smooth scrolling.
-   **Google Fonts:** For custom typography.
-   **Font Awesome:** For icons.
